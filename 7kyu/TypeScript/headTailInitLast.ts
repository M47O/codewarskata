/* Haskell has some useful functions for dealing with lists:

$ ghci
GHCi, version 7.6.3: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
位 head [1,2,3,4,5]
	1
位 tail [1,2,3,4,5]
	[2,3,4,5]
位 init [1,2,3,4,5]
	[1,2,3,4]
位 last [1,2,3,4,5]
	5

Your job is to implement these functions in your given language. Make sure it doesn't edit the array; that would cause problems! Here's a cheat sheet:

| HEAD | <----------- TAIL ------------> |
[  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9,  10]
| <----------- INIT ------------> | LAST |

head [x] = x
tail [x] = []
init [x] = []
last [x] = x

Here's how I expect the functions to be called in your language:
head([1,2,3,4,5]); => 1
tail([1,2,3,4,5]); => [2,3,4,5] */

//Solution:
export const head = (arr: number[]): number => {
  return arr[0]
}

export const tail = (arr: number[]): number[] => {
  return arr.slice(1)
}

export const init = (arr: number[]): number[] => {
  return arr.slice(0, arr.length - 1)
}

export const last = (arr: number[]): number => {
  return arr[arr.length - 1]
}
