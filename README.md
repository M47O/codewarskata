> [Codewars](https://codewars.com) is an educational community for computer programming. On the platform, software developers train on programming challenges known as kata.
> These discrete programming exercises train a range of skills in a variety of programming languages, and are completed within an online integrated development environment.


This repo is a collection of my solutions to Codewars challenges (kata). Every solution is written in JavaScript and TypeScript. Every day, I write and push one solution at the very least.

<sup>10/09/2023 - 
I've begun adding my C# kata solutions. I will rewrite this README at a later date to be more representative of the many programming languages I've grown to know and use.

The methods available to accomplish each solution vary from kata to kata, as not every kata is written to use the most up-to-date [NodeJS](https://nodejs.dev/) run-time. 
For example, many kata leverage NodeJS version 14.0.0. If I wanted to solve such a kata using `String.protoytype.replaceAll()`, I could not because the method wasn't made available in NodeJS until version 15.0.0. 

The next logical step would be to just use `String.prototype.replace()` and pass in a regex pattern using the global (`g`) flag as an argument.

However, as of now, not a single solution of mine makes use of regex, even for kata that call for regex to be used. 
This is intentional, as it creates opportunities that require using methods I do not regularly use or have never used, 
thus offering a chance to deepen my understanding of these methods and explore new ways in which they can be used.
